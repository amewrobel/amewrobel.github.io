        <h1>San Francisco: the best and the worst</h1>
        <h2>The Best: The Richmond</h2>
        <p>I like The Richmond because of its proximity to the park, the more residential feel and the great food. It's also <strong>great</strong> to be near the ocean.</p>
        <h2>The Worst: The FiDi</h2>
        <p>The FiDi has <em>such</em> bad traffic. It is smelly, crowded, and overwhelming.</p>
